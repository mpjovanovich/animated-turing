# Animated Turing

## TODO: V1

mFunctions work at runtime, but "FindSymbol" has a logic bug - it's not jumping to the right m-config when the write head is sitting on the symbol to be found, so it stays in state 'f' infinitely.

"subargs" branch is ready to be merged.

- Add back existing UI
- Add m-config tables for non m-function machines
- Integrate m-functions into m-config tables
- Add animations to smooth transitions and highlight important information
- Polish UI, bringing it up to _minimal_ professional level
- Device testing
- Review comments / README and clean codebase
- Add brief explanation pages. Don't get carried away with this or we will hit scope-creep issues.
- _THIS IS ENOUGH FOR V1!_

## V1.1

Project management scaffolding put in place:

- Git Issues
- Web host
- App store submissions
